 " <O> LONDON 1996-08-23 Implied volatility of  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> cut in interest rates , traders said  </O> " | 

 " <O> Volatility has come off a lot  </O> " | 

 " <O> We 're looking for it to stabilise now , said one  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> options trader at a  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> bank  </O> " | 

 " <O> A trader at a  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> bank said  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June  </O> " | 

 " <O> This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said  </O> " | 

 " <O> At 1347  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> , December  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day  </O> " | 

 " <O> He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels  </O> " | 

 " <O> He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end  </O> " | 

 " <O> The size of the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> 's repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise  </O> " | 

 " <O> Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , he said  </O> " | 

 " <O> Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high  </O> " | 

 " <O> It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit  </O> " | 

 " <O> He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " | 

 " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> options specialist  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> , it should be higher next Tuesday  </O> " | 

 " <O> He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> ,  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> and  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " | 

 " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size  </O> " | 

 " <O> I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> and  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> in particular  </O> " | 

 " <O> With high-yielding markets  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options  </O> " |

 " <O> Human rights lawyer  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee  </O> " | 

 " <O> I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , he said  </O> " | 

 " <O> That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all  </O> " | 

 " <O> The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds  </O> " |

 " <O> Anne  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> 1996-08-23 Corporate  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study  </O> " | 

 " <O> What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely  </O> " | 

 " <O> But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less  </O> " | 

 " <O> The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task  </O> " | 

 " <O> Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> , a  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> principal  </O> " | 

 " <O> In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on knowledge , skill and abilities , she said  </O> " | 

 " <O> In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals  </O> " | 

 " <O> The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , said  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " | 

 " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less  </O> " | 

 " <O> Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result  </O> " | 

 " <O> Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees  </O> " | 

 " <O> This coming shift ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said , is not just isolated or a fad  </O> " | 

 " <O> It 's an inexorable change  </O> " | 

 " <O> After  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> , corporations adopted a military model creating hierarchical organisations where the concept of defined tasks worked great , she said  </O> " | 

 " <O> But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex  </O> " | 

 " <O> Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " | 

 " <O> Now organisations must change to stay competitive  </O> " | 

 " <O> O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises  </O> " | 

 " <O> If your team does well , you 'll do well  </O> " | 

 " <O> If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise  </O> " | 

 " <O> Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ?  </O> " | 

 " <O> That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , said  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " | 

 " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> 's not a question we ask any more  </O> " | 

 " <O> The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ?  </O> " | 

 " <O> ' To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education  </O> " | 

 " <O> Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " | 

 " <O> For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as high-performing companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent  </O> " |

 " <O> WASHINGTON 1996-08-28 The  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders  </O> " | 

 " <O> The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote  </O> " | 

 " <O> The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them  </O> " | 

 " <O> The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time  </O> " | 

 " <O> Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock  </O> " | 

 " <O> In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices  </O> " | 

 " <O> These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , said  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> Chairman  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " |

 " <O> It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market  </O> " | 

 " <O> It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to hidden quotes the benefit of the best available prices  </O> " |

 " <O> The  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed  </O> " | 

 " <O> The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the price improvement proposal again  </O> " |

 " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis  </O> " | 

 " <O> I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all  </O> " | 

 " <O> For  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand  </O> " |

 " <O> Just three years ago  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> semifinal and winning three tournaments  </O> " | 

 " <O> But  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury  </O> " | 

 " <O> The  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> finally hit a low of 44th two months ago  </O> " |

 " <O> In the original draw ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> and  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> were slotted to play each other  </O> " |

 " <O> Obviously we are interested in this research  </O> " | 

 " <O> We will ask the (  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it ,  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> spokesman  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> told  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " | 

 " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> and its 14  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> partners  </O> " | 

 " <O> We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> cases possible  </O> " | 

 " <O> I think it would be very difficult to sell to the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> cases ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " | 

 " <O> We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , he said  </O> " | 

 " <O> We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue  </O> " | 

 " <O> The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> , he added  </O> " | 

 " <O> The reaction is likely to disappoint  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> farmers , who seized on research by  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> scientists in the scientific journal  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle  </O> " | 

 " <O> The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> before 2001  </O> " | 

 " <O> British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report  </O> " | 

 " <O> I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue ,  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> president Sir  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> told  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " | 

 " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> said there was no need for  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> partners  </O> " | 

 " <O> The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> accepted this evidence ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " | 

 " <O> The report could well reopen a damaging row between  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> and the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> , which slapped a worldwide ban on  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> beef after the government said there could be a link between  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> and the human form of the disease  </O> " | 

 " <O> The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> (  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> ) from eating  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> beef  </O> " |

 " <O> Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin  </O> " |

 " <O> Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said  </O> " |

 " <O> They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term  </O> " | 

 " <O> On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality  </O> " |

 " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , one said  </O> " | 

 " <O> But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents  </O> " | 

 " <O> The differential is not normally as wide as this , he added  </O> " | 

 " <O> Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents  </O> " | 

 " <O> One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term  </O> " | 

 " <O> Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> on Thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week  </O> " | 

 " <O> Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes  </O> " |

 " <O> The  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , he added  </O> " | 

 " <O> India has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its October tender  </O> " | 

 " <O> Traders said the award could be  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> 's lowest in recent years  </O> " | 

 " <O> After  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> 's very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes , I 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October , another said  </O> " | 

 " <O> But traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term , with some surplus arising closer to October  </O> " | 

 " <O> I see an overhang of gas oil further out , one said  </O> " | 

 " <O> Gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-September with the premium of around $ 1 for 0.5 percent ( sulphur material )  </O> " | 

 " <O> In the second half of September and October we see the premium coming off to 70-75 cents  </O> " | 

 " <O> Traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil , with the premium at 40 to 45 cents  </O> " |

 " <O> LONDON 1996-08-29 The chairman of  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> components and engineering group  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets  </O> " | 

 " <O> In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets  </O> " | 

 " <O> Looking at market prospects , he said : I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half  </O> " | 

 " <O> It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year  </O> " | 

 " <O> It could be better , or it could be worse ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries  </O> " | 

 " <O> You can see anxieties in  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> and  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> , in particular , beginning to grow and develop  </O> " | 

 " <O> America , however , is looking a little better , he said  </O> " | 

 " <O> Compared with the end of last year , when  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said : I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half  </O> " | 

 " <O> Against this background ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago  </O> " | 

 " <O> I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> ) mines actually is not bad  </O> " | 

 " <O> It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , he added , saying : We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle  </O> " | 

 " <O> We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it  </O> " | 

 " <O> And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> said  </O> " | 

 " <O> When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , he added  </O> " |

 " <O> Rubin 's predecessor at the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " | 

 " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> , under the  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , said  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> , an international economist at  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> Under  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> , the  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> has certainly looked for a strong dollar  </O> " | 

 " <O> That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> lows of 1.3438  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> yen on April 19 , 1995  </O> " | 

 " <O> Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen  </O> " | 

 " <O> Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> , part of which were spent as co-chairman of  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " |

 " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> has done a fine job in that position , said  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> , a portfolio manager at  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds  </O> " | 

 " <O> Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill  </O> " | 

 " <O> Fear that a new  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> secretary might favour a return to  </O> " " <MISC> " Var_MISC " </MISC> " " <O> policy could spell trouble for financial markets  </O> " | 

 " <O> Some overseas investors might shy away from buying  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening  </O> " | 

 " <O> As for  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> securities ,  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> explained that  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> 's reappointment as chairman of the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> continues at the  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " |

 " <O> Still , markets may have little to fear from any  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results  </O> " | 

 " <O> If that is true , then any new  </O> " " <ORG> " Var_ORG " </ORG> " " <O> chief would need to be as effective as  </O> " " <PER> " Var_PER " </PER> " " <O> in convincing markets that the  </O> " " <LOC> " Var_LOC " </LOC> " " <O> does indeed want a strong currency  </O> " |
